**Project in beta**

Tested pipelines:
- fxDockerImage

## Description

This image contains a jenkins headless to run pipeline on any workstation.
The image is based on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner (alpine).
See [Usage](#Usage)

## How it works
Jenkins itself as well as all plugins used by FX are installed in this docker image.
As a consequence, this image is very similar to [FX own Jenkins slave image](https://scm.dazzlingwrench.fxinnovation.com/fxinnovation-public/docker-jenkinsk8sslave)
Because there is no full Jenkins running in the background but just the core, Jenkins credentials or pipeline libraries does not work out of the box.
To circumvent the issue, configuration must be done with a configuration file.
It is possible using the [Configuration As Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/) module to handle credentials and pipeline libraries, which is installed by default in this docker.

## Tags
We push a `latest` tag on this repository, to run an older version please checkout the different tags.

## Usage

1. Setup a gitea token (Configuration > Applications > Manage tokens);
1. Update credentials in your configuration file;
1. Change directory to the code you want to test;
1. Copy `resource/jenkins.yaml` to a local path (e.g. ~/.config/jenkins_runner/configuration). Careful, might contain passwords, so protect the file!;
1. Populate the passwords you need for your pipeline in the `~/.config/jenkins_runner/configuration/jenkins.yaml` file. If the following docker command fails with 'password does not exists', you need to add it in the confiugration file.
1. Run:

```
    docker run --rm \
        -v $(pwd):/workspace/ -w /workspace \ # This allow this docker image to access the project Jenkinsfile
        -e JENKINS_DOCKER_DATA_BASEPATH=$(pwd) \ # This will allow FX pipeline dockers to run locally, by knowing where are the source files in the host
        -v ~/.config/jenkins_runner/configuration/:/usr/share/jenkins/ref/casc \ # This will give jenkins the access to your custom config files, containing passwords
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ # This will allow the docker image to run other dockers
        fxinnovation/jenkins-runner:latest \ # The name of the image. Prefer to use a tagged version
        --no-sandbox # disables Jenkins security sandbox, not very useful in a local environment
```
